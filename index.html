    <h2>Problem statement: [Too many different platforms]</h2> 
    <p>
        [The professors of U of SC usually use Blackboard to post assignments, but there are some that post assignments on other platforms, and it makes it harder to find what assignments you have to do for each class. It would be a lot simpler if they had their assignments in one spot.]

[My storyboard describes a man that is frustrated because all of his assignments are spread apart in different applications, causing him to not be able to get his assignments in on time. Luckily he stubbles across and application that comprises all of his assignments in one so he doesn't have to go throught the hassle of keeping track of his assignments through various platforms.] </p>
